We learn three aspects:
1. Learning how to program - object, data structure, control flow
2. readable code - organize and modularize system using object calsses and methods
3. complexities of algorithm

Then, let's see the basic machine architecture, which is going through from the top to the bottom. As shown in the figure, the fundamental layer is Memory, the other is the _input_ and _output_. The _ALU_ (arithmetic logit unit) is where all of the operations are done.

Sequence of **instructions stored** inside computer built from predefined set of primitive instructions: (a) arithmetic and logic (b) simple test (c) moving data. Special program (interpreter) executes each instruction in order - a.use tests to change flow of control through sequence; b. stop when done. A great computer scientist Alan Turning showed that you can compute anything by using those _six instructions_ and the piece of tape:
1. Right - move the machine's head to the right of the current square
2. Left - Move the Machineâ€™s head to the left of the current square
3. Print- Print a symbol on the current square
4. Scan - Identify any symbols on the current square
5. Erase - Erase any symbols presented on the current square
6. Nothing/halt - Do nothing.
